# API Dataset Generator (ADG)

## Overview

The API Dataset Generator (ADG) is a dedicated component within the Agape approach, tasked with the generation of datasets that encompass all 12 general information data required for similarity analyses. This dataset is crafted using a Cartesian Product, which juxtaposes all response attributes present in each endpoint of an API with every input attribute in all other APIs. The primary intention is to create a comprehensive dataset facilitating in-depth similarity analyses.

The essence of ADG's functionality is rooted in the [Algorithm section](#Algorithm). This algorithm harnesses the information extracted from the APIs by the [API Syntactic Extractor (ASE)](https://github.com/marcosborges1/api-syntactic-extractor-service). It then returns a dataset formulated through the Cartesian Product of the 12 general information data points.

## Implementation Details

The core of ADG is defined by the intricate Algorithm \ref{alg:dataset}. This algorithm, designed to seamlessly integrate with the data provided by the API Syntactic Extractor, facilitates the creation of a robust and comprehensive dataset vital for similarity analysis tasks.

## Algorithm

The ADG's core is based on the algorithm described below.

## Setup

Before running the application, make sure to install the required dependencies. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Before you start registering the microservices below, be sure to start them.

```bash
python server.py
```

**Note**:

- The default PORT is _4002_, but can be change for your convenience.
- This project heavily relies on GraphQL, a powerful query language for APIs, and a server-side runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. If you're unfamiliar with GraphQL or wish to dive deeper, you can [learn more about GraphQL here](https://graphql.org/).

## Project Status

The ADG, currently in the evolutionary phase, functions as a proof of concept. It is actively undergoing improvements and changes to refine its capabilities and more effectively meet new requirements.
